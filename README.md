# winfredtestpackage

This package details my helper functions through my Ph.D.
The current functions are meant to calculate the standard errors for different settings.

se_calculator needs only standard deviation (`sd`) and sample size(`n`).

se_diff_calculator aims to calculate a difference's standard errors (pass two standard deviations(`sd1 and sd2`) and the two sample sizes (`n1 and n2`) for each group).
